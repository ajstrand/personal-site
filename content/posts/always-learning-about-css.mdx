## No matter how long you've been coding there's always more to learn.

I recently ran into an issue where I had some content in my website footer that looked like this

```jsx
<p>
  built with
  <a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>
  and hosted on
  <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>
</p>
```

Example:

Between the two attribution tags in my footer, there was no space for the phrase 'and honsted on' between the anchor tags.

It's been that way on my site for a while now and i was confused as to why the html wasn't lying out like i expected.

I finally googled and found an answer on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33384318/how-to-use-nbsp-in-html5).

Since i wasn't putting my text in the same line as my anchor tags,
i would have to use a non breaking space `&nbsp` to create space for the text.

Example:

But the Stackoverflow thread pointed towards a better solution.
To use the [whitespace property from Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space).

Using the `pre` property of the whitespace css rule:

```css
a {
  white-space: "pre";
}
```

Example:

I would now get the whitespace I wanted. The full explanation from the docs is

`Sequences of white space are preserved. Lines are only broken at newline characters in the source and at <br> elements`

The final code of my solution looked something like this:

```jsx
const determineResult = (type) => {
  const { prop } = type;
  let result;
  let temp;
  switch (prop) {
    case "noCSS":
      temp = null;
      break;
    case "nbsp":
      temp = "non-breaking-space";
      break;
    case "pre":
      temp = "pre";
      break;
    default:
      console.log(`${prop} not a valid option`);
      break;
  }
  result = temp;
  return result;
};

const CSSWhitespace = (cssType) => {
  let useCSS = determineResult(cssType);
  const whiteSpaceStyle = {
    whiteSpace: "pre",
  };
  const useWhiteSpace = useCSS === "pre" ? whiteSpaceStyle : null;
  const useNBSP = useCSS === "non-breaking-space" ? <span>&nbsp;</span> : null;
  return (
    <p>
      built with
      {useNBSP} <a style={useWhiteSpace} href="https://gatsbyjs.org">
        Gatsby
      </a> {useNBSP}
      <span>and</span>
      {useNBSP} <a style={useWhiteSpace} href="https://netlify.com">
        Netlify
      </a>.
    </p>
  );
};
```

Its about 40 some lines of code and not exactly the simplist solution.

After spending more time than neccesary
on the React example code of the various approaches
I tried on how to handle the spacing/whitspace issue, I had a realization.

My problem could be solved with much less code than i thought.

The approach I took is shown below.

```jsx
const UpdatedIdea = () => {
  const linkVar = (link, text) => <a href={link}>{text}</a>;
  return (
    <p>
      built with {linkVar("https://gatsbyjs.org", "Gatsby")}{" "}
      <span>and hosted on</span> {linkVar("https://netlify.com", "Netlify")}
    </p>
  );
};
```

Example:

The shown idea is that you can use a function to return an anchor tag with the data i need. This means I can put my copyright text on one line
without needing css to manage the whitespace/spacing(HTML will do that for me).

This results in far less code written.
I further shortened the space used by my function calls by assigning those calls to variables like so:

```jsx
const gatsbyLink = externalLinkText(
  "https://gatsbyjs.org",
  "Gatsby",
  "Gatsby framework website url"
);
const netlifyLink = externalLinkText(
  "https://www.netlify.com",
  "Netlify",
  "Netlify website URL"
);
```

This reduces the amount of space taken up in my text and therefore makes the code easier to read in my editor.
