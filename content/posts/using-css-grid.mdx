# Mistakes that can be made when using CSS grid

I noticed recently that the css in my personal site was not behaving as I expected.
My footer was uch too larger on mobile devices.

When I started learning CSS grid, I had set the two sections of my main content
to have specfic `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end` values.

Top Section:

```css
main {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: end;
  grid-row-start: 1;
  grid-row-end: 3;
}
```

Footer:

```css
footer {
  grid-row-start: 2;
  grid-row-end: end;
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: end;
}
```

I realized that into addition to the `grid-row-end` value for the `main` element being wrong, I wasn't using CSS Grid to it's full potential.

The fix I used came from [this post on dev.to](https://dev.to/niorad/keeping-the-footer-at-the-bottom-with-css-grid-15mf).

In my Layout component, I had CSS that looked like this:

_note: some lines omuitted for clarity_

```css
div {
  grid-template-rows: "1fr 1fr";
  @media screen and (min-width: 30em) {
    grid-template-rows: "1fr 50px";
  }
}
```

In my default `grid-template-rows` rule, the values I was using said that each row in the grid should be as tall as it possibly can.

Instead what I needed to use was `grid-template-rows:1fr auto;`.

What this says is that the first row will grow to take up as much space as possible.
Auto will just set the second row to only take up as much space as it normally would.

_note: I Am not a CSS Grid expert, so explannations may be somewhat confusing.
For a more detailed explanation of CSS Grid,
see [the mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout)_.

Using the `grid-template-rows` syntax I described above, I was able to solve my problem and also get rid of a lot of unneccesaary css.
