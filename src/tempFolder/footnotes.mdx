# Footnotes in React/Preact

### Footnotes are a nice way to explain info in long pieces of text

I'm using a fork of
[this](https://kittygiraudel.com/2020/11/24/accessible-footnotes-and-a-bit-of-react/)
library by @kittygiraudel to render footnotes that are accessible.

Testing was proving difficult with Jest and Preact, so I moved the library to Vite.
