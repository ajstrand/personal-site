# Rendering math in MDX files

Rendering mathematical equations/formula in `.mdx` files isnt as stright forward as pure markdowmn.

According to the MDX Docs site, you need to add these two plugins to your build step.

`rehype-katex` and `remark-math`

Im using Vite, so adding the plugins looks like this

```js
import rehypeKatex from "rehype-katex";
import remarkMath from "remark-math";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: mdx({
    rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex],
    remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],
  }),
});
```

Adding those plugins to mny `vite.config.js` file lets me use math notation like this:

$\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

$y = mx + b$
