It's easy to get distracted by new web development tooling, especially in regards to javascript and it's wide ecosystem.

However, there's been new tools showing up that use `Rust`.

Rust allows these tools to run much faster than something written in just javascript.

### oxlint

Example of a lint from a file in a project using `oxlint`

```bash

  ⚠ eslint-plugin-react(jsx-key): Missing "key" prop for element in iterator.
    ╭─[src/List.jsx:18:38]
 17 │ const CreateList = ({ pages }) => {
 18 │   return pagesWithTag(pages, "post").map(({ meta, urlPath }) => {
    ·                                      ─┬─
    ·                                       ╰── Iterator starts here
 19 │     const { date, title } = meta;
 20 │     let withoutTrailingSlash = urlPath.slice(0, urlPath.length - 1);
 21 │     let urlPathFull = `${withoutTrailingSlash}.html`;
 22 │     let env = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" ? urlPath : urlPathFull;
 23 │     return (
 24 │       <ListElement urlPath={urlPath} title={title} date={date} env={env} />
    ·        ─────┬─────
    ·             ╰── Element generated here
 25 │     );
    ╰────
  help: Add a "key" prop to the element in the iterator (https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key).
```

Oxlint ran much faster than eslint, and even includes many of the popular rule sets
that people use in their projects.

## Biome

Biome is another option gaining quite a bit of adoption these days. It's also written in rust.
